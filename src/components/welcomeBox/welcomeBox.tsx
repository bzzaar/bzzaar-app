            This website is a simple user interface that is available as free,
            public, open-source or source-available software, and is only a
            possible way to display the decentralised peer-to-peer and
            peer-to-protocol Swarm bonding curve (‚ÄúBzzaar‚Äù), which can also be
            displayed directly by accessing the Ethereum blockchain or by any
            other user interface. Bzzaar is a smart contract deployed and
            running autonomously on the decentralized public Ethereum blockchain
            that can be used to swap BZZ ERC-20 utility tokens to DAI and ETH
            and vice versa. Your access and use of Bzzaar is at your own risk.
            Before engaging with Bzzaar, you should review the relevant
            documentation to make sure you understand how Bzzaar and the Swarm
            network works. Bzzaar does not have access to your private key and
            cannot initiate a transfer or otherwise access your tokens. We are
            not your brokers, intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians,
            and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or obligation to you
            regarding any other decisions or activities that you effect when
            using your wallet or a Bzzaar graphical user interface.
          </div>{" "}
          <div className={classes.paragraph}>
            Your engagement with the bonding curve involves various risks,
            including, but not limited to, the entire loss of your BZZ or
            DAI/ETH due to errors or defects in the code of the bonding curve or
            interruptions, attacks or disruptions of the bonding curve or the
            Swarm Network, losses while tokens are being supplied to Bzzaar and
            losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair
            or liquidity pool.

            Although Swarm Association and its affiliated persons and entities

            can interfere with the bonding curve, other than by stopping its
            operation which will lock its vault irreversibly, in case of

            Welcome to Bzzaarüêù, a decentralised two-way token vending machine
            where you may obtain BZZ tokens for use in the Swarm network and
            return your BZZ at a value in DAI or ETH dictated by supply and
            demand and the bonding curve formula. You may use BZZ to purchase
            postage stamps in order to host your content in the Swarm network or
            to speed up your Swarm uploads and downloads.
